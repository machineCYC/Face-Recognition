## Summary

## Dataset

* [Yale Facedatabase A](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database), also known as Yalefaces. The AT&T Facedatabase is good for initial tests, but it’s a fairly easy database. The Eigenfaces method already has a 97% recognition rate on it, so you won’t see any great improvements with other algorithms. 
* The Yale Facedatabase A (also known as Yalefaces) is a more appropriate dataset for initial experiments, because the recognition problem is harder. The database consists of 15 people (14 male, 1 female) each with 11 grayscale images sized 320 $\times$ 243 pixel. There are changes in the light conditions (center light, left light, right light), facial expressions (happy, normal, sad, sleepy, surprised, wink) and glasses (glasses, no-glasses).
